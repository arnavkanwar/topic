The Making of a Global World

1 The Pre-modern World

When we talk of 'globalisation' we often refer to an economic system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so. But as you will see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today, we need to understand the phases through which this world in which we live has emerged.

All through history, human societies have become steadily more interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods, money, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases.

1.1 Silk Routes Link the World

The silk routes are a good example of vibrant pre-modern trade and cultural links between distant parts of the world. The name 'silk routes' points to the importance of West-bound Chinese silk cargoes along this route. Historians have identified several silk routes, over land and by sea, knitting together vast regions of Asia, and linking Asia with Europe and northern Africa. They are known to have existed since before the Christian Era and thrived almost till the fifteenth century. But Chinese pottery also travelled the same route, as did textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return, precious metals – gold and silver – flowed from Europe to Asia.

Trade and cultural exchange flourished along these routes. Buddhist preachers, Christian missionaries and later Muslim preachers travelled on these routes spreading their faiths. Much before all this, it is believed that the Chinese pottery that reached the Roman Empire was carried along the silk routes.

1.2 Food Travels: Spaghetti and Potato

Many of our common foods such as potatoes, soya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chillies, sweet potatoes, and so on were not known to our ancestors until about five centuries ago. These foods came to Europe and Asia from the Americas after Christopher Columbus accidentally discovered the vast continent.

Sometimes the new crops could make the difference between life and death. Europe's poor began to eat better and live longer with the introduction of the humble potato. Ireland's poorest peasants became so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died of starvation.

2 The Nineteenth Century (1815-1914)

The world changed profoundly in the nineteenth century. Economic, political, social, cultural and technological factors interacted in complex ways to transform societies and reshape external relations.

Economists identify three types of movement or 'flows' within international economic exchanges. The first is the flow of trade which in the nineteenth century referred largely to trade in goods (e.g., cloth or wheat). The second is the flow of labour – the migration of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.

2.1 A World Economy Takes Shape

A good place to start is the changing pattern of food production and consumption in industrial Europe. Traditionally, countries liked to be self-sufficient in food. But in nineteenth-century Britain, self-sufficiency in food meant high food prices and social conflict. The solution was found in imports. As food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. By the 1890s, Britain was importing much of its food requirements.

This was made possible by the development of faster industrial transport – larger ships helped move food more cheaply and more quickly from faraway farms to final markets. Railways linked agricultural regions to ports. Refrigerated ships enabled the transport of perishable foods over long distances.

2.2 Role of Technology

The development of the cotton industry is a good example. Britain could not grow cotton, but its textile industry was the largest in the world. The raw material came from India, Egypt, and the USA. New machines and steam power transformed the cotton industry. The invention of the cotton gin made it possible to separate cotton fibre from the seeds much faster than by hand.

Technology also played a crucial role in connecting distant parts of the world. The telegraph was invented in the 1850s. By 1872, a cable was laid across the Atlantic Ocean. This made it possible to send messages across the ocean in a matter of minutes rather than weeks.

CONCLUSION

The making of the global world has been a long process spanning many centuries. From the ancient silk routes to the technological innovations of the nineteenth century, human societies have continuously become more interconnected through trade, migration, and cultural exchange.
